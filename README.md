# Today I Learned (TIL)

A public collection of small things I learn day-to-day across a variety of subjects, including technologies, trivia, facts, and cultures. This repository is where I document my journey of **"Learning In Public."**

### ðŸš€ About This Repo

The notes here are concise, single-topic write-ups that don't quite warrant a full blog post. This list will grow as I learn new concepts or re-learn old ones that are not yet documented here.

This repository is my public-facing "second brain," specifically for topics I'm comfortable sharing.
